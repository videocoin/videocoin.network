          VideoCoin Network rewards workers and delegators up to 80% of the
          price paid by publishers in cash rather than from the minting of new
          tokens to pay rewards.
          <br />
          <br />
          Other projectsâ€™ inflation-based reward systems continually add supply
          in to the market, assuming demand will continuously increase at the
          same rate in order to keep the value of the token stable. However, if
          supply is added while demand remains static, their token value falls.
